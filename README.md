# Exploratory_Data_Analysis-Iris_Dataset

I have done Data Analysis on Iris datasets.

In this I've used Python’s visualization techniques for analysis.

I've used Jupyter Notebook {https://jupyter.org/} for coding!

You can follow along the Jupyter Notebook for more!

# Iris Dataset Info

This data sets consists of 3 different types of irises’ (Setosa, Versicolour, and Virginica) petal and sepal length.

The rows being the samples and the columns being: Sepal Length, Sepal Width, Petal Length and Petal Width.

See here for more information on this dataset : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_flower_data_set .

# Data Insights:

* **The pdf curve of Iris Setosa ends roughly at 2.1,**
* **If petal length < 2.1, then species is Iris Setosa,**
* **The point of intersection between pdf curves of Versicolor and Virginica is roughly at 4.8,**
* **If petal length > 2.1 and petal length < 4.8 then species is Iris Versicolor,**
* **If petal length > 4.8 then species is Iris Virginica.**
